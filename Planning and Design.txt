                                                        Lottery Algorithm

    1. The lottery starts by accepting ETH transactions. Anyone having an ethereum wallet can send a fixed amount of 0.1eth to the contract's address

    2. The players send ETH directly to the contracts address and their ethereum address is registered. A user can send more than one transactions
       having more chances to win

    3. There is a Manager , the account that deploys and controls the contract

    4. At some point if there are atleast 10 players, the Manager can pick a random winner from the player list. Only the manager is allowed to see 
       see the contract balance and randomly select the winner

    5. The contract will transfer the entire balance to winner's address and the lottery is reset for the next round

    6. The manager should not be able to participate in the lottery

    7. The manager receives a fee of 10% of the lottery funds.
